return value from the child process, pass the `ignore' symbol as

will leave *emacs* process buffers hanging around):

Special case:
If the output of START-FUNC is a string with properties
e.g. (buffer-string) RESULT will be transformed in a list where the
car is the string itself (without props) and the cdr the rest of
properties, this allows using in FINISH-FUNC the string without
properties and then apply the properties in cdr to this string (if
needed).
Properties handling special objects like markers are returned as
list to allow restoring them later.
See <https://github.com/jwiegley/emacs-async/issues/145> for more infos.

Note: Even when FINISH-FUNC is present, a future is still
returned except that it yields no value (since the value is
passed to FINISH-FUNC).  Call `async-get' on such a future always

command, skipping initialization.

If 'noresume, this instance of `helm' cannot be resumed.

*** :preselect

Initially selected candidate (string or regexp).

*** :buffer

Buffer name for this Helm session. `helm-buffer' will take this value.

*** :keymap

[Obsolete]

Keymap used at the start of this Helm session.

It is overridden by keymaps specified in sources, and is kept
only for backward compatibility.

Keymaps should be specified in sources using the :keymap slot
instead. See `helm-source'.

This keymap is not restored by `helm-resume'.

*** :default

Default value inserted into the minibuffer with
\\<minibuffer-local-map>\\[next-history-element].

It can be a string or a list of strings, in this case
\\<minibuffer-local-map>\\[next-history-element] cycles through
the list items, starting with the first.

If nil, `thing-at-point' is used.

If `helm-maybe-use-default-as-input' is non-nil, display is
updated using this value if this value matches, otherwise it is
ignored. If :input is specified, it takes precedence on :default.

*** :history

Minibuffer input, by default, is pushed to `minibuffer-history'.

When an argument HISTORY is provided, input is pushed to
HISTORY. HISTORY should be a valid symbol.

*** :allow-nest

Allow running this Helm command in a running Helm session.

** Other keywords

Other keywords are interpreted as local variables of this Helm
session. The `helm-' prefix can be omitted. For example,

(helm :sources 'helm-source-buffers-list
       :buffer \"*helm buffers*\"
       :candidate-number-limit 10)

Starts a Helm session with the variable
`helm-candidate-number-limit' set to 10.

** Backward compatibility

For backward compatibility, positional parameters are
supported:

(helm sources input prompt resume preselect
       buffer keymap default history allow-nest)

However, the use of non-keyword args is deprecated.

- COLLECTION can be a list, alist, vector, obarray or hash-table.
  For alists and hash-tables their car are use as real value of
  candidate unless ALISTP is non-nil.
  It can be also a function that receives three arguments:
  the values string, predicate and t. See `all-completions' for more details.

Keys description:

- TEST: A predicate called with one arg i.e candidate.

- INITIAL-INPUT: Same as input arg in `helm'.

- PRESELECT: See preselect arg of `helm'.

- DEFAULT: This option is used only for compatibility with regular
  Emacs `completing-read' (Same as DEFAULT arg of `completing-read').

- BUFFER: Name of helm-buffer.

- MUST-MATCH: Candidate selected must be one of COLLECTION.

- FUZZY: Enable fuzzy matching.

- REVERSE-HISTORY: When non--nil display history source after current
  source completion.

- REQUIRES-PATTERN: Same as helm attribute, default is 0.

- HISTORY: A symbol where each result will be saved.
  If not specified as a symbol an error will popup.
  When specified, all elements of HISTORY are displayed in
  a special source before or after COLLECTION according to REVERSE-HISTORY.
  The main difference with INPUT-HISTORY is that the result of the
  completion is saved whereas in INPUT-HISTORY it is the minibuffer
  contents which is saved when you exit.
  Don't use the same symbol for INPUT-HISTORY and HISTORY.
  NOTE: As mentionned above this has nothing to do with
  `minibuffer-history-variable', therefore if you want to save this
  history persistently, you will have to add this variable to the
  relevant variable of your favorite tool for persistent emacs session
  i.e. psession, desktop etc...

- RAW-HISTORY: When non-nil do not remove backslashs if some in
  HISTORY candidates.

- INPUT-HISTORY: A symbol. The minibuffer input history will be
  stored there, if nil or not provided, `minibuffer-history'
  will be used instead.  You can navigate in this history with
  `M-p' and `M-n'.
  Don't use the same symbol for INPUT-HISTORY and HISTORY.

- CASE-FOLD: Same as `helm-case-fold-search'.

- PERSISTENT-ACTION: A function called with one arg i.e candidate.

- PERSISTENT-HELP: A string to document PERSISTENT-ACTION.

- MODE-LINE: A string or list to display in mode line.
  Default is `helm-comp-read-mode-line'.

- KEYMAP: A keymap to use in this `helm-comp-read'.
  (the keymap will be shared with history source)

- NAME: The name related to this local source.

- HEADER-NAME: A function to alter NAME, see `helm'.

- EXEC-WHEN-ONLY-ONE: Bound `helm-execute-action-at-once-if-one'
  to non--nil. (possibles values are t or nil).

- VOLATILE: Use volatile attribute.

- SORT: A predicate to give to `sort' e.g `string-lessp'
  Use this only on small data as it is inefficient.
  If you want to sort faster add a sort function to
  FC-TRANSFORMER.
  Note that FUZZY when enabled is already providing a sort function.

- FC-TRANSFORMER: A `filtered-candidate-transformer' function
  or a list of functions.

- HIST-FC-TRANSFORMER: A `filtered-candidate-transformer'
  function for the history source.

- MARKED-CANDIDATES: If non-nil return candidate or marked candidates as a list.

- NOMARK: When non--nil don't allow marking candidates.

- ALISTP:
  When non-nil (default) pass the value of (DISPLAY . REAL)
  candidate in COLLECTION to action when COLLECTION is an alist or a
  hash-table, otherwise DISPLAY is always returned as result on exit,
  which is the default when using `completing-read'.
  See `helm-comp-read-get-candidates'.

- CANDIDATES-IN-BUFFER: when non--nil use a source build with
  `helm-source-in-buffer' which is much faster.
  Argument VOLATILE have no effect when CANDIDATES-IN-BUFFER is non--nil.

- MATCH-PART: Allow matching only one part of candidate.
  See match-part documentation in `helm-source'.

- MATCH-DYNAMIC: See match-dynamic in `helm-source-sync'
  It has no effect when used with CANDIDATES-IN-BUFFER.

- ALLOW-NEST: Allow nesting this `helm-comp-read' in a helm session.
  See `helm'.

- MULTILINE: See multiline in `helm-source'.

- COERCE: See coerce in `helm-source'.

- GROUP: See group in `helm-source'.

Any prefix args passed during `helm-comp-read' invocation will be recorded
in `helm-current-prefix-arg', otherwise if prefix args were given before
`helm-comp-read' invocation, the value of `current-prefix-arg' will be used.
That means you can pass prefix args before or after calling a command
that use `helm-comp-read'.  See `helm-M-x' for example.
